# Market Research
Death apps do exist. However, a lot of deaths apps focus on reminding the user of his or her own death. This is a different use case from the proposed memorial app.
## Afternote
* Poor UI (funeral home vibe with lighthouses and beaches).
* Price Point: Free
* Offers social media integration. 
* But it does offer an interesting hierarchy of individuals to contact.
  * This is necessary (friends, family, others.)
* No mobile app

## Final Wish
* Poor UI.
* Somewhat more convincing. 
* Price Point: Free / Med / High pricing tier.
* No mobile app
