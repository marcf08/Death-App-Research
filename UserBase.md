# User Base Size and Scope Study

## Background / Ballpark Estimations
* Reddit and Quora searches indicate that very few individuals are aware of Afternote or Final Wish.
  * Hence, the assumption is that a memorial app may have some novelty value among 18 - 25 year olds.
  * Moreover, Afternote and Final Wish have a small web presence.
    * **Afternote**: Alexa rank ~11.9m.
    * **FinalWish**: Not enough data for Alexa rank.
   
By any standard, these are not popular services. Hence, the classic dilemma: the hypothesized product is either extremely original (unlikely) or there isn't a market for it (more likely).

## Assumptions
* Sudden death, such as by car accident, is not a viable use case. Although we would like for users to use the
app ahead of such tragedies, the reality is that the overwhelming majority of the population does not really think about their death
until it is imminent (such as after having received a terminal diagnosis). As a case in point, an AARP Survey found that
2 out of 5 Americans over the age of 45 do not have a will prepared. 
* Based on the AARP survey, we can therefore conclude that 3 out of 5 Americans over the age of 45 both THINK about their death AND consciously choose to do something about it.
  * Moreover, a will is a widely recognized legal document. Hence, a less known memorial app would have a smaller userbase than the population who is both aware of their death AND does somethig about it.
